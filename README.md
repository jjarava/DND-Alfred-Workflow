# DND For Alfred

To put it simply I wanted a way to tell the world to bugger off so I could get work done. However, its much better when you can time it, so with this you can time your disconnecting from the world.

Once you add the workflow to Alfred, you can use the following command.

```
dnd 45
```

This will enable macOS's DND for 45 minutes. It will output a pleasant notification when the timer runs out.
